<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 15px;">

Belief propagation (BP) is a classical algorithm that approximates the marginal distribution associated with a factor graph by passing messages between adjacent nodes. <br>
In 2016, Renes belief propagation with quantum messages <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aa7c78/pdf">(BPQM) </a> and described how it could be used to decode classical codes defined by tree factor graphs that are sent over the classical-quantum pure-state channel.<br>
In this research, we extend the classical belief propagation algorithm to a method called Paired Measurement Belief Propagation with Quantum Messages (PM-BPQM) for binary symmetric classical-quantum (BSCQ) channels. A tree factor graph based classical code can be analyzed using two channel combining operations- check-node and bit-node combining. We obtained sufficient statistics based on classical parameters for channel combining operations (check-node and bit-node combining) for quantum states from CQ channel outputs via PM-BPQM. Using these classical parameters and monte carlo based density evolution, we characterized the asymptotic performance (e.g. finding noise thresholds) of tree based codes (regular low-denisty parity-check (LDPC), polar codes) over BSCQ channels.
<br> We deveoped PM-BPQM based polar decoder over BSCQ channels and provided its performance.
